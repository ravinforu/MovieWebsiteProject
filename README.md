# Movie Website Project

This is a simple Movie Website project where users can see their favorite movies and watch the trailers

## Pre-requisites

In order for this project to successfully run, you need Python 2.7.x installed in your machine. The version used in my machine at the time of development of this project is 2.7.12. If you do not have Python in your machine, you can download it from [Python official download site](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install it in your machine depending on the operating system and the appropriate instruction given in the [Python Install Guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/).

With Python installed and verified by the command
    python --version
you are all set with the environment required for the project

## Structure of this project

When you download this project, you will be able to see the below structure of files and directories inside the project.
```

├── media.py
├── entertainment_center.py
├── fresh_tomatoes.py
├── README.md
```

## How to run this project

The starting point of execution of this project is entertainment_center.py. All you have to do is to run this python file from command-line.
    python entertainment_center.py
This will generate fresh_tomatoes.html by using the fresh_tomatoes.py script provided (Thanks to Udacity). If your system is set with a proper browser for opening html files, it will automatically open the generated fresh_tomatoes.html file. If a default browser is not set for html files, go to the location of your project and open the generated fresh_tomatoes.html file in the browser.
